## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

### ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned

**1. Concept: Branching**  
`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: I thought branching was mainly for big projects and teams.  
`Reality ðŸ˜…`: I realized even solo developers benefit from branching.  
`Impact ðŸ’¡`: Helped me safely test features like the About section without breaking the main site.

**2. Concept: Pull Requests**  
`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: I expected pull requests to just be for team code reviews.  
`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Turns out theyâ€™re great even for personal projectsâ€”to track progress, link issues, and manage merges.  
`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I used PRs for each section (Navbar, Hero, Projects, etc.) and linked them to the correct issue.

**3. Concept: Merge Conflicts**  
`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: I thought merge conflicts only happen when two people work on the same file.  
`Reality ðŸ˜…`: They can also happen when working across multiple branches.  
`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I practiced resolving a conflict between two branches and understood how to avoid and fix them.

**4. Concept: GitHub Projects & Issues**  
`Expectation ðŸ‘€`: I thought they were for large-scale planning only.  
`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Even for my small site, breaking tasks into issues and organizing them into milestones helped a lot.  
`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I stayed organized with my 4 milestones and 8 issues and tracked progress clearly.
